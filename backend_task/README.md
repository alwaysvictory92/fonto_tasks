# Fonto Backend Task

This repository demonstrates the designated backend task created with Python 3 and Visual Studio Code. 

The backend tass ingest data from "australian_post_codes.txt" and "streets.csv" which is used for processing the address in "sample_addresses.csv". The output of this program is the generated "output.csv" containing the address as desired comma separated. The mentioned three files are kept in "files" directory.  

The backend task consist of *main.py* containing the solution of the task and other files includes textfile and csv file that is given to the program and generated as an output.

## How to Execute File

The following steps guidelines the successful execution of the file. 

---
1. Through command-line either from command prompt (windows) or Terminal (linux/MacOS) make sure the path is same as the directory of the *main.py* file and input file exist in the same directory. 
2. In command-line type *python3 main.py* 
3. Once program is executed successfully, output.csv is generated in the files directory. The addresses which were not Australian were discarded with error message on console during the process. 
4. You can open the CSV file to check the successful implementation of the program.

## Assumption 

For this task, it is assumed that all the address are Australian and it would required to discard any other incorrect address format or address of another country. 

## Potential Design Improvement 

During the implementation, it was found that the file consist of an address of US and an Australian address without postcode however, the address was correct. We solved this using the following strategy. 

---

1. For addresses of another country, we made an assumption, that each address will be Australian with correct formatting i.e. *Street No Street Name Suburb State Postcode*. Hence, discarding the addresses that does not match in the mentioned format. For such address console prints out the error while the application continue to execute. 

2. Implementation is made to find the postcode from Suburb Name and State from the file "australian_post_codes.txt"

3. To extract street no and name, it was only possible to extract from left side rather than right side. However, right side possibilities are there however, suburb name would has to be reverted. For this we used file streets.csv downloaded from <a href="https://jaspreetchahal.org/australian-street-types-and-abbreviations-database/"> This Link </a> and ingested in the program which is used to processs the street name.

## Demonstration

The demonstration of the application is as following. 

Make sure that the files directory with files "australian_post_codes.txt", "streets.csv" and "sample_addresses.csv" are the contents of the directory. Then execute *python3 main.py* in the command line.

The executed program will generate the output.csv file and in the console, if any address insertion was unsuccessful it will print out the error along with the address. 

The following is the view of output.csv file generated by the application.
